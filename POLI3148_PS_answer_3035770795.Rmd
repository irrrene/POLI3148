## Background

In 1998, Mexico had a close presidential election. Irregularities were detected around the country during the voting process. For example, when 2% of the vote tallies had been counted, the preliminary results showed the PRI's imminent defeat in Mexico City metropolitan area and a very narrow vote margin between PRI and FDN. A few minutes later, the screens at the Ministry of Interior went blank, an event that electoral authorities justified as a technical problem caused by an overload on telephone lines. The vote count was therefore suspended for three days, despite the fact that opposition representatives found a computer in the basement that continued to receive electoral results. Three days later, the vote count resumed, and soon the official announced PRI's winning with 50.4% of the vote.

*What happened on that night and the following days? Were there electoral fraud during the election?* A political scientist, Francisco Cantú, unearths a promising dataset that could provide some clues. At the National Archive in Mexico City, Cantú discovered about 53,000 vote tally sheets. Using machine learning methods, he detected that a significant number of tally sheets were *altered*! In addition, he found evidence that the altered tally sheets were biased in favor of the incumbent party. In this Problem Set, you will use Cantú's replication dossier to replicate and extend his data work.

Please read Cantú (2019) for the full story. And see Figure 1 for a few examples of altered (fraudulent) tallies.

\clearpage

## Task 0. Loading required packages (3pt)

For Better organization, it is a good habit to load all required packages up front at the start of your document. Please load the all packages you use throughout the whole Problem Set here.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(sf)
```

\clearpage

## Task 1. Clean machine classification results (3pt)

Cantú applys machine learning models to 55,334 images of tally sheets to detect signs of fraud (i.e., alteration). The machine learning model returns results recorded in a table. The information in this table is messy and requires data wrangling before we can use them.

### Task 1.1. Load classified images of tally sheets

The path of the classified images of tally sheets is `data/classification.txt`. Your first task is loading these data onto R using a `tidyverse` function. Name it `d_tally`.

Note:

-   Although the file extension of this dataset is `.txt`, you are recommended to use the `tidyverse` function we use for `.csv` files to read it.

-   Unlike the data files we have read in class, this table has *no column names*. Look up the documentation and find a way to handle it.

-   There will be three columns in this dataset, name them `name_image`, `label`, and `probability`.

Print your table to show your output.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally <- read_csv("data/classification.txt", 
  col_names = FALSE)
colnames(d_tally) <- c("name_image", "label", "probability")

print(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

### Note 1. What are in this dataset?

Before you proceed, let me explain the meaning of the three variables.

-   `name_image` contains the names of of the tallies' image files (as you may infer from the `.jpg` file extensions. They contain information about the locations where each of the tally sheets are produced.

-   `label` is a machine-predicted label indicating whether a tally is fraudulent or not. `label = 1` means the machine learning model has detected signs of fraud in the tally sheet. `label = 0` means the machine detects no sign of fraud in the tally sheet. In short, `label = 1` means fraud; `label = 0` means no fraud.

-   `probability` indicates the machine's certainty about its predicted `label` (explained above). It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values mean higher level of certainty.

Interpret `label` and `probability` carefully. Two examples can hopefully give you clues about their correct interpretation. In the first row, `label = 0` and `probability = 0.9991`. That means the machine thinks this tally sheet is NOT FRAUDULENT with a probability of 0.9991. Then, the probability that this tally sheet is fraudulent is `1 - 0.9991 = 0.0009`. Take another example, in the 11th row, `label = 1` and `probability = 0.935`. This means the machine thinks this tally sheet IS FRAUDULENT with a probability of 0.935. Then, the probability that it is NOT FRAUDULENT is `1 - 0.9354 = 0.0646`.

\clearpage

### Task 1.2. Clean columns `label` and `probability`

As you have seen in the printed outputs, columns `label` and `probability` are read as `chr` variables when they are actually numbers. A close look at the data may tell you why --- they are "wrapped" by some non-numeric characters. In this task, you will clean these two variables and make them valid numeric variables. You are required to use `tidyverse` operations to for this task. Show appropriate summary statistics of `label` and `probability` respectively after you have transformed them into numeric variables.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
d_tally$label <- str_remove_all(d_tally$label, "\\[|\\]")
d_tally$probability <- str_remove_all(d_tally$probability, "\\[|\\]")

d_tally$label <- as.numeric(d_tally$label)
d_tally$probability <- as.numeric(d_tally$probability)

summary(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

### Task 1.3. Extract state and district information from `name_image`

As explained in the note, the column `name_image`, which has the names of tally sheets' images, contains information about locations where the tally sheets are produced. Specifically, the first two elements of these file names indicates the **states'** and districts' identifiers respectively, for example, `name_image = "Aguascalientes_I_2014-05-26 00.00.10.jpg"`. It means this tally sheet is produced in state **`Aguascalientes`**, district **`I`**. In this task, you are required to obtain this information. Specifically, create two columns named `state` and `district` as state and district identifiers respectively. You are required to use `tidyverse` functions to perform the task.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally <- d_tally |>
  separate(name_image, into = c("state", "district"), sep = "_", remove = FALSE, extra = "drop")
print(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

### Task 1.4. Re-code a state's name

One of the states (in the newly created column `state`) is coded as "`Estado de Mexico`." The researchers decide that it should instead re-coded as "**`Edomex`**." Please use a `tidyverse` function to perform this task.

Hint: Look up functions `ifelse` and `case_match`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally <- d_tally |>
  mutate(state = if_else(state == "Estado de Mexico", "Edomex", state))
print(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

### Task 1.5. Create a *probability of fraud* indicator

As explained in Note 1, we need to interpret `label` and `probability` with caution, as the meaning of `probability` is conditional on the value of `label`. To avoid confusion in the analysis, your next task is to create a column named `fraud_proba` which indicates the probability that a tally sheet is is fraudulent. After you have created the column, drop the `label` and `probability` columns.

*Hint: Look up the `ifelse` function and the `case_when` function (but you just need either one of them).*

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally <- d_tally |>
  mutate(fraud_proba = if_else(label == 0, 1 - probability, probability))

d_tally <- d_tally |> select(-label, -probability)

print(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

### Task 1.6. Create a binary *fraud* indicator

In this task, you will create a binary indicator called `fraud_bin` in indicating whether a tally sheet is fraudulent. Following the researcher's rule, we consider a tally sheet fraudulent only when the machine thinks it is at least 2/3 likely to be fraudulent. That is, `fraud_bin` is set to TRUE when `fraud_proba` is greater to `2/3` and is FALSE otherwise.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally <- d_tally |>
  mutate(fraud_bin = if_else(fraud_proba > 2/3, TRUE, FALSE))
print(d_tally)
```

\clearpage

## Task 2. Visualize machine classification results (3pt)

In this section, you will visualize the `tally` dataset that you have cleaned in Task 1. Unless otherwise specified, you are required to use the `ggplot` packages to perform all the tasks.

### Task 2.1. Visualize distribution of `fraud_proba`

How is the predicted probability of fraud (`fraud_proba`) distributed? Use two methods to visualize the distribution. Remember to add informative labels to the figure. Describe the plot with a few sentences.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(d_tally, aes(fraud_proba)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Predicted Probability of Fraud",
       x = "Fraud Probability",
       y = "Count")

ggplot(d_tally, aes(fraud_proba)) +
  geom_density(color = "blue4") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Predicted Probability of Fraud",
       x = "Fraud Probability",
       y = "Count")

# The two plot shows that the machine learning is generally confident in its result, 
#as most of the fraud probability is close to 0 and 1. 
#Plus, votes identified as fraud is around half of those identified as real. 
```

\clearpage

### Task 2.2. Visualize distribution of `fraud_bin`

How many tally sheets are fraudulent and how many are not? We may answer this question by visualizing the binary indicator of tally-level states of fraud. Use at least two methods to visualize the distribution of `fraud_bin`. Remember to add informative labels to the figure. Describe your plots with a few sentences.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}

barplot(table(d_tally$fraud_bin),
        main = "Distribution of Fraud",
        xlab = "Fraud",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        col = c("steelblue", "orange"))
# The bar plot shows the number of fraud or not with a visualized comparison on the number.


pie(table(d_tally$fraud_bin),
        main = "Proportion of Fraud",
    labels = paste0(round(fraud_proportions * 100, 1), "%"))
legend("topright", 
       c("Not Fraud", "Fraud"), 
       fill = c("white", "lightblue"))
# By contrast, the pie chart emphasize the proportion of the two types, 
#while not showing the real number
```

The figure below serve as a reference. Feel free to try alternative approach(es) to make your visualization nicer and more informative.

\clearpage

### Task 2.3. Summarize prevalence of fraud by state

Next, we will examine the between-state variation with regards to the prevalence of election fraud. In this task, you will create a new object that contains two state-level indicators regarding the prevalence of election fraud: The count of fraudulent tallies and the proportion of fraudulent tallies.

```{r}

d_tally_state <- d_tally |> group_by(state) |> summarise(n_fraud = sum(fraud_bin == TRUE), prop_fraud= 100*n_fraud/n())
print(d_tally_state)
```

\clearpage

### Task 2.4. Visualize frequencies of fraud by state

Using the new data frame created in Task 2.3, please visualize the *frequencies* of fraudulent tallies of every state. Describe the key takeaway from the visualization with a few sentences.

Feel free to try alternative approach(es) to make your visualization nicer and more informative.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(d_tally_state, aes(x = reorder(state, n_fraud), y = n_fraud)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()  +
  ggtitle("Fraud by State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Number of Fraudulent Tally Sheets") 

# It could be found that Veracruz is the worst in fraud tally sheets, and 
# significantly exceeds other states.
# Baja California Sur, Quintana Roo, Aguascalientes, Hidalgo, and 
# Colima, the five states has almost no fraud sheets
```

\clearpage

### Task 2.5. Visualize proportions of fraud by state

Using the new data frame created in Task 2.3, please visualize the *proportion of* of fraudulent tallies of every state. Describe the key takeaway from the visualization with a few sentences.

Feel free to try alternative approach(es) to make your visualization nicer and more informative.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(d_tally_state, aes(x = reorder(state, prop_fraud), y = prop_fraud)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Fraud by State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Proportion of Fraud Cases") 

# Almost all states has a proportion of fraud sheets less than 60%
# And roughly 2/3 of them falls under 40%
```

\clearpage

### Task 2.6. Visualize both proportions & frequencies of fraud by state

Create data visualization to show BOTH the *proportions* and *frequencies* of fraudulent tally sheets by state in one figure. Include annotations to highlight states with the highest level of fraud. Add informative labels to the figure. Describe the takeaways from the figure with a few sentences.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_tally_state <- d_tally_state[order(-d_tally_state$prop_fraud), ]

plot_2 <- ggplot(d_tally_state, aes(x = reorder(state, n_fraud), y = n_fraud, fill = d_tally_state$prop_fraud)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "cyan", high = "black") +
  ggtitle("Fraud by State") +
  xlab("State") +
  ylab("Number of Fraud Cases") +
  labs(fill = "frequency of 
fraud by state")

plot_2 + geom_bar(data = d_tally_state[1, ], stat = "identity", fill = "red")
# In my graph, the length of the bar indicates the number of fraud sheets. 
# Therfore, the state with highest number, Veracruze, is put on top. 
# The state with highest frequency, Tlaxala, is highlighted in red.
# Surprisingly, Tlacala hsas a relatively low number in fraud sheets. 
# Veracruz is the worst state both in number and frequency.
```

\clearpage

## Task 3. Clean vote return data (3pt)

Your next task is to clean a different dataset from the researchers' replication dossier. Its path is `data/Mexican_Election_Fraud/dataverse/VoteReturns.csv`. This dataset contains information about vote returns recorded in every tally sheet. This dataset is essential for the replication of Figure 4 in the research article.

### Task 3.1. Load vote return data

Load the dataset onto your R environment. Name this dataset `d_return`. Show summary statistics of this dataset and describe the takeaways using a few sentences.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_return <- read_csv("data/VoteReturns.csv")

summary(d_return)

# The dataset has 92 variables and 53499 entries, combing character and 
#numerical data
```

\clearpage

### Note 2. What are in this dataset?

This table contains a lot of different variables. The researcher offers no comprehensive documentation to tell us what every column means. For the sake of this problem set, you only need to know the meanings of the following columns:

-   `foto` is an identifier of the images of tally sheets in this dataset. We will need it to merge this dataset with the `d_tally` data.

-   `edo` contains the names of states.

-   `dto` contains the names of districts (in Arabic numbers).

-   `salinas`, `clouthier`, and `ibarra` contain the counts of votes (as recorded in the tally sheets) for presidential candidates Salinas (PRI), Cardenas (FDN), and Clouthier (PAN). In addition, the summation of all three makes the total number of **presidential votes**.

-   `total` contains the total number of **legislative votes**.

\clearpage

### Task 3.2. Recode names of states

A state whose name is `Chihuahua` is mislabelled as `Chihuhua`. A state whose name is currently `Edomex` needs to be recoded to `Estado de Mexico`. Please re-code the names of these two states accordingly.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_return$edo <- gsub("Chihuhua", "Chihuahua", d_return$edo)
d_return$edo <- gsub("Edomex", "Estado de Mexico", d_return$edo)
```

\clearpage

### Task 3.3. Recode districts' identifiers

Compare how districts' identifiers are recorded differently in the tally (`d_tally`) from vote return (`d_return`) datasets. Specifically, in the `d_tally` dataset, `district` contains Roman numbers while in the `d_return` dataset, `dto` contains Arabic numbers. Recode districts' identifiers [in the `d_return` dataset]{.underline} to match those in the `d_tally` dataset. To complete this task, first summarize the values of the two district identifier columns in the two datasets respectively to verify the above claim. Then do the requested conversion.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# summarize
table(d_tally$district)
table(d_return$dto)
# convert
d_return$dto <- (as.roman(d_return$dto))
d_return$dto <- as.character(d_return$dto)
```

\clearpage

### Task 3.4. Create a `name_image` identifier for the `d_return` dataset

In the `d_return` dataset, create a column named `name_image` as the first column. The column concatenate values in the three columns: `edo`, `dto`, and `foto` with an underscore `_` as separators.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_return <- d_return %>% 
  mutate(name_image = paste(d_return$edo, d_return$dto, d_return$foto, sep = "_"), 
         .before = foto)
```

\clearpage

### Task 3.5. Wrangle the `name_image` column in two datasets

As a final step before merging `d_return` and `d_tally`, you are required to perform the following data wrangling. For the `name_image` column in BOTH `d_return` and `d_tally`:

-   Convert all characters to lower case.

-   Remove ending substring `.jpg`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_return$name_image <- tolower(d_return$name_image)
d_return$name_image <- sub("\\.jpg$", "", d_return$name_image)

d_tally$name_image <- tolower(d_tally$name_image)
d_tally$name_image <- sub("\\.jpg$", "", d_tally$name_image)
```

\clearpage

### Task 3.6 Join classification results and vote returns

After you have successfully completed all the previous steps, join `d_return` and `d_tally` by column `name_image`. This task contains two part. First, use appropriate `tidyverse` functions to answer the following questions:

-   How many rows are in `d_return` but not in `d_tally`? Which states and districts are they from?

-   How many rows are in `d_tally` but not in `d_return`? Which states and districts are they from?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# in d_return not in d_tally
atj_d_return <- anti_join(d_return, d_tally, by = "name_image")
table(atj_d_return$dto)
table(atj_d_return$edo)

# in d_tally not in d_return
atj_d_tally <- anti_join(d_tally, d_return, by = "name_image") 
table(atj_d_tally$district)
table(atj_d_tally$state)
```

Second, create a dataset call `d` by joining `d_return` and `d_tally` by column `name_image`. `d` contains rows whose identifiers appear in *both* datasets and columns from *both* datasets.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d <- merge(d_tally, d_return, by = "name_image")
```

\clearpage

## Task 4. Visualize distributions of fraudulent tallies across candidates (6pt)

In this task, you will visualize the distributions of fraudulent tally sheets across three presidential candidates: **Sarinas (PRI)**, **Cardenas (FDN)**, and **Clouthier (PAN)**. The desired output of is reproducing and extending Figure 4 in the research article (Cantu 2019, pp. 720).

### Task 4.1. Calculate vote proportions of Salinas, Clouthier, and Cardenas

Before getting to the visualization, you should first calculate the proportion of votes (among all) received by the three candidates of interest. As additional background information, there are two more presidential candidates in this election, whose votes received are recorded in `ibarra` and `castillo` respectively. Please perform the tasks in the following two steps on the `d` dataset:

-   Create a new column named `total_president` as an indicator of the total number of votes of the 5 presidential candidates.

-   Create three columns `salinas_prop`, `cardenas_prop`, and `clouthier_prop` that indicate the proportions of the votes these three candidates receive respectively.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d$total_president <- d$ibarra + d$castillo + d$salinas + d$cardenas + d$clouthier

d$salinas_prop <- d$salinas / d$total_president
d$cardenas_prop <- d$cardenas / d$total_president
d$clouthier_prop <- d$clouthier / d$total_president
```

\clearpage

### Task 4.2. Replicate Figure 4

Based on all the previous step, reproduce Figure 4 in Cantu (2019, pp. 720).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
d_gathered <- d %>%
  gather(key = "candidates", value = "candidate_prop", salinas_prop, cardenas_prop, clouthier_prop)  %>%
  mutate(candidate = case_when(
    candidates == "salinas_prop" ~ "Salinas (PRI)",
    candidates == "cardenas_prop" ~ "Cardenas (FDN)",
    candidates == "clouthier_prop" ~ "Clouthier (PAN)",
    TRUE ~ candidates 
  ))

ggplot(d_gathered, aes(x = candidate_prop, fill = fraud_bin, linetype = fraud_bin, linecolor = fraud_bin, colour = fraud_bin, outline.type = "upper")) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("skyblue2","orange"), labels = c("Tallies
identified with
alterations", "Tallies
identified with
no alterations")) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("skyblue2", "orange"), labels = c("Tallies
identified with
alterations", "Tallies
identified with
no alterations")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("solid", "dashed"), labels = c("Tallies
identified with
alterations", "Tallies
identified with
no alterations")) +
  facet_wrap(~ candidate, ncol = 1, 
             strip.position = "right",
             scales = "free_y") +
  xlab("Vote Share") +
  ylab("Density")
  labs(fill = "", color = "", linetype = "", linecolor = "") 
  
```

Note: Your performance in this task will be mainly evaluated based on your output's similarity with the original figure. Pay attention to the details. For your reference, below is a version created by the instructor.

\clearpage

### Task 4.3. Discuss and extend the reproduced figure

Referring to your reproduced figures and the research articles, in what way is the researcher's argument supported by this figure? Make an alternative visualization design that can substantiate and even augment the current argument. After you have shown your alternative design, in a few sentences, describe how your design provides visual aid as effectively as or more effectively than the original figure.

**Note:** Feel free to make *multiple* alternative designs to earn bonus credits. However, please be selective. Only a design with major differences from the existing ones can be counted as an alternative design.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# The image indicates that for tallies where the Salina, 
# leader of PRI has a close to 100% vote share, there is 
# significantly higher frequencies of altered tallies 
# (shown by the blue line) compared to the otehr two candidates, 
# indicating a suspicious situation. This observation could be 
# overlooked if only focus on the clean tallies, where Salinas 
# did has high vote share. 

ggplot(d_gathered, aes(x = candidate, y = candidate_prop, fill = candidate)) +
    geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkred","gold3","darkgreen")) + 
  facet_wrap(~ fraud_bin, ncol = 1) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Proportion of Candidate in Each Tally")

# To better illustrate the conclusion emphasized by the author, I facet the 
# graph by fraud_bin instead of candidate. This would allow us to directly 
# compare the porportion of each candidate in tallies identified with false. 
# In the upper graph, it is more evident that Salinas has significantly more 
# false tally for those supports her in a large proportion.
```

**Note:** Feel free to suggest *multiple* alternative designs to earn bonus credits. However, please be selective. Only a design with major differences from the existing ones can be counted as an alternative design.

## Task 5. Visualize the discrepancies between presidential and legislative Votes (6pt)

In this task, you will visualize the differences between the number of presidential votes across tallies. The desired output of is reproducing and extending Figure 5 in the research article (Cantu 2019, pp. 720).

### Task 5.1. Get district-level discrepancies and fraud data

As you might have noticed in the caption of Figure 5 in Cantu (2019, pp. 720), the visualized data are aggregated to the *district* level. In contrast, the unit of analysis in the dataset we are working with, `d`, is *tally*. As a result, the first step of this task is to aggregate the data. Specifically, please aggregate `d` into a new data frame named `sum_fraud_by_district`, which contains the following columns:

-   `state`: Names of states

-   `district`: Names of districts

-   `vote_president`: Total numbers of presidential votes

-   `vote_legislature`: Total numbers of legislative votes

-   `vote_diff`: Total number of presidential votes minus total number of legislative votes

-   `prop_fraud`: Proportions of fraudulent tallies (hint: using `fraud_bin`)

```{r, echo=TRUE}

sum_fraud_by_district <- d |>
  group_by(state, district) |>
  summarise(vote_president = sum(total_president),
            vote_legislature = sum(total),
            prop_fraud = mean(fraud_bin == "TRUE", na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(vote_diff = vote_president - vote_legislature)

print(sum_fraud_by_district)
 
```

\clearpage

### Task 5.2. Replicate Figure 5

Based on all the previous step, reproduce Figure 5 in Cantu (2019, pp. 720).

```{r, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(sum_fraud_by_district, aes(x = vote_legislature, y = vote_president, size = prop_fraud)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
  labs(x = "Total Legislative Votes", y = "Total Presidential Votes", 
  size = "Proportion of tallies
identified with
alterations") +
  theme_bw()
```

**Note 1:** Your performance in this task will be mainly evaluated based on your output's similarity with the original figure. Pay attention to the details.

**Note 2:** The instructor has detected some differences between the above figure with Figure 5 on the published article. Please use the instructor's version as your main benchmark.

### Task 5.3. Discuss and extend the reproduced figure

Referring to your reproduced figures and the research articles, in what way is the researcher's argument supported by this figure? Make an alternative visualization design that can substantiate and even augment the current argument. After you have shown your alternative design, in a few sentences, describe how your design provides visual aid as effectively as or more effectively than the original figure.

**Note:** Feel free to make *multiple* alternative designs to earn bonus credits. However, please be selective. Only a design with major differences from the existing ones can be counted as an alternative design.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

## Task 6. Visualize the spatial distribution of fraud (6pt)

In this final task, you will visualize the spatial distribution of electoral fraud in Mexico. The desired output of is reproducing and extending Figure 3 in the research article (Cantu 2019, pp. 720).

### Note 3. Load map data

As you may recall, map data can be stored and shared in **two** ways. The simpler format is a table where each row has information of a point that "carves" the boundary of a geographic unit (a Mexican state in our case). In this type of map data, a geographic unit is is represented by multiple rows. Alternatively, a map can be represented by a more complicated and more powerful format, where each geographic unit (a Mexican state in our case) is represented by an element of a `geometry` column. For this task, I provide you with a state-level map of Mexico represented by both formats respectively.

Below the instructor provide you with the code to load the maps stored under the two formats respectively. Please run them before starting to work on your task.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# IMPORTANT: Remove eval=FALSE above when you start this part!

# Load map (simple)
map_mex <- read_csv("data/map_mexico/map_mexico.csv")
# Load map (sf): You need to install and load library "sf" in advance
map_mex_sf <- st_read("data/map_mexico/shapefile/gadm36_MEX_1.shp")
map_mex_sf <- st_simplify(map_mex_sf, dTolerance = 100)


# Bonus Question: the st_simplify() function simplifies the map data to a certian degree, measured by dTolerance, by removing certices and reduce the level of details in the map_mex_sf. This operation could make the data file smaller and the final graph more concise. 

```

**Bonus question**: Explain the operations on `map_mex_sf` in the instructor's code above.

**Note**: The map (sf) data we use are from <https://gadm.org/download_country_v3.html>.

### Task 6.1. Reproduce Figure 3 with `map_mex`

In this task, you are required to reproduce Figure 3 with the `map_mex` data.

Note:

-   Your performance in this task will be mainly evaluated based on your output's similarity with the original figure. Pay attention to the details. For your reference, below is a version created by the instructor.

-   Hint: Check the states' names in the map data and the electoral fraud data. Recode them if necessary.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

map_mex$state_name <- gsub("Yucatán", "Yucatan", map_mex$state_name)
map_mex$state_name <- gsub("San Luis Potosí", "San Luis Potosi", map_mex$state_name)
map_mex$state_name <- gsub("Querétaro", "Queretaro", map_mex$state_name)
map_mex$state_name <- gsub("Nuevo León", "Nuevo Leon", map_mex$state_name)
map_mex$state_name <- gsub("Michoacán", "Michoacan", map_mex$state_name)
map_mex$state_name <- gsub("México", "Edomex", map_mex$state_name)

d_map_mex <- merge(map_mex, d_tally_state, by.x = "state_name", by.y = "state", all.x = TRUE)

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = d_map_mex, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = prop_fraud))  +
  theme_void() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_blank()) +
   scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "black") + 
  labs(title = "Rates of Tallies Classified as Altered by State",
       fill = "Proportion
of altered
tallies") 


```

### Task 6.2. Reproduce Figure 3 with `map_mex_sf`

In this task, you are required to reproduce Figure 3 with the `map_mex` data.

Note:

-   Your performance in this task will be mainly evaluated based on your output's similarity with the original figure. Pay attention to the details. For your reference, below is a version created by the instructor.

-   Hint: Check the states' names in the map data and the electoral fraud data. Recode them if necessary.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

map_mex_sf$NAME_1 <- gsub("Yucatán", "Yucatan", map_mex_sf$NAME_1)
map_mex_sf$NAME_1 <- gsub("San Luis Potosí", "San Luis Potosi", map_mex_sf$NAME_1)
map_mex_sf$NAME_1 <- gsub("Querétaro", "Queretaro", map_mex_sf$NAME_1)

### Task 6.3. Discuss and extend the reproduced figures

Referring to your reproduced figures and the research articles, in what way is the researcher's argument supported by this figure? Make an alternative visualization design that can substantiate and even augment the current argument. After you have shown your alternative design, in a few sentences, describe how your design provides visual aid as effectively as or more effectively than the original figure.f

**Note:** Feel free to make *multiple* alternative designs to earn bonus credits. However, please be selective. Only a design with major differences from the existing ones can be counted as an alternative design.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Aligned with the author's argument, most of the tallies with alterations, illustrated by darker shade of black, locates in the souther part of Mexico.  

#data preparation
sum_fraud_by_state <- sum_fraud_by_district %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(vote_president = sum(vote_president))

d_map_extend <- merge(d_map_sf, sum_fraud_by_state, by = "state")
